Installation
============

Python >= 3.6 is required, and the recommended way of installing is either using a ``virtualenv`` or ``conda`` virtual environment. ``remake`` can be installed using ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install remake
    $ remake version
    $ remake -h

::

    >>> import remake
    >>> print(remake.__version__)

See the :ref:`quickstart` guide for what to try next.
